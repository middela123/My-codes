Question:

Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {6,1,2,8,3,4,7,10,5}
Output: 9

Your Task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Answer:

n=int(input())
k=[i for i in map(int,input().split())]
k=sorted(k)
i=k[0]
for j in range(1,len(k)):
    i=i+1
    if((i)!=k[j]):
        print(i,end="")
