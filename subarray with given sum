Question:
Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.

In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A[] = {1,2,3,7,5}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements 
from 2nd position to 4th position 
is 12.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 10, S = 15
A[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
Output: 1 5
Explanation: The sum of elements 
from 1st position to 5th position
is 15.


Ans:

N=int(input())
S=int(input())
m=1
k=[i for i in map(int,input().split())]
for i in range(N):
    cur_sum=0
    while(m):
        for j in range(i,N):
            cur_sum=cur_sum+k[j]
            if(cur_sum==S):
                print(i+1,j+1)
                m=0
